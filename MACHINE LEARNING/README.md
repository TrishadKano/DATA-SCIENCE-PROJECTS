## Project List

## Project : LLM Chatbot Using Google Gemini Pro ðŸ¤–âœ¨

## Description:
- In this project, I developed a chatbot system integrated with Google's Gemini Pro LLM (Large Language Model) API. The chatbot leverages Gemini Pro's advanced natural language understanding and generation capabilities to engage in intelligent, human-like conversations. It is deployed using Streamlit, enabling an interactive and responsive web-based user interface for seamless real-time communication.

### Aim:

- To build and deploy an LLM-based chatbot using Google Gemini Pro that provides dynamic, context-aware conversational responses to user inputs for tasks such as general Q&A, summarisation, and assistance, enhancing productivity and user experience.

### Tools Used:

- Python (Requests, Streamlit)

- Google Gemini Pro API

- Streamlit (for user interface and deployment)

## Project : Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a Public DatasetðŸ“Š

### Description:

- Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a publicly available dataset Titanic dataset from Kaggle).

- Cleaned the data, handled missing values, and conducted basic statistical analysis.

- Visualised data distributions, correlations, and key patterns using charts and graphs.

### Aim:


- To explore, clean, and visualise the Titanic dataset to uncover patterns, correlations, and insights that inform survival outcomes.

### Tools Used:

The project involves data scraping, preprocessing, and building a machine learning model to identify customer perceptions and feedback trends. This enables businesses and analysts to gain insights into customer satisfaction and areas requiring improvement.

### Aim:

- To build and deploy a sentiment analysis model that accurately classifies Amazon Tesla product reviews, thereby assisting in understanding customer opinions, enhancing product development strategies, and supporting data-driven business decisions.

### Tools Used:
- Python (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, requests)

- scikit-learn (for model building, training, and evaluation)

- pandas & numpy (for data manipulation and preprocessing)

- Jupyter Notebook (for development and experimentation)
  
- Streamlit (for user interface and deployment)



## Project : Simple Linear Regression on Housing Prices (Model Building)

### Description:

- Used a housing prices dataset (Boston Housing dataset).

- Performed data preprocessing, including feature selection and normalisation.

- Built a linear regression model to predict house prices based on features like the number of rooms, square footage, etc.

### Aim:


- To build a predictive model using simple linear regression for estimating housing prices based on key numerical features in the Boston Housing dataset.

### Tools Used:

- Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

### Key Features:

- Data exploration and preprocessing

- Implementation of machine learning models

- Evaluation of model performance

- Use of Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, and Matplotlib

### Technologies Used:

- Python

- Machine Learning (Classification Algorithms)

- Data Visualisation



## Project : Credit_Fraud_Detection using Logistic Regression


### Description:


- In this project, I built a credit card fraud detection system using Logistic Regression to classify transactions as fraudulent or legitimate based on transaction data patterns. The objective was to detect anomalies in financial transactions and reduce false positives through proper model evaluation and preprocessing steps.

### Aim:


- To develop a machine learning model using Logistic Regression that accurately classifies credit card transactions as either fraudulent or legitimate, enhancing fraud detection capability and minimizing financial losses.

### Tools Used:


- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

- Jupyter Notebook



## Project : Disease Prediction System Using SVM ðŸ©º


### Description


- In this project, I developed a machine learning-based disease prediction system using the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm. SVM was chosen for its effectiveness in handling high-dimensional data and binary classification problems. The system processes healthcare datasets containing features such as blood pressure, glucose levels, BMI, age, and more.


### Aim:


- To build and deploy a disease prediction system using SVM that provides accurate, real-time medical predictions based on patient data inputs, supporting early diagnosis and intervention.
