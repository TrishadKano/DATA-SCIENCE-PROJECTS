# What is Breast Cancer?

Cancer occurs when changes called mutations take place in genes that regulate cell growth. The mutations let the cells divide and multiply in an uncontrolled, chaotic way. The cells keep on proliferating, producing copies that get progressively more abnormal. In most cases, the cell copies eventually end up forming a tumor.

Breast cancer occurs when a malignant (cancerous) tumor originates in the breast. As breast cancer tumors mature, they may metastasize (spread) to other parts of the body. The primary route of metastasis is the lymphatic system which, ironically enough, is also the body's primary system for producing and transporting white blood cells and other cancer-fighting immune system cells throughout the body. Metastasized cancer cells that aren't destroyed by the lymphatic system's white blood cells move through the lymphatic vessels and settle in remote body locations, forming new tumors and perpetuating the disease process.

Breast cancer is not just a woman's disease. It is quite possible for men to get breast cancer, although it occurs less frequently in men than in women. Our discussion will focus primarily on breast cancer as it relates to women but it should be noted that much of the information is also applicable for men.

# Role Of Machine Learning In Detection Of Breast Cancer

A mammogram is an x-ray picture of the breast. It can be used to check for breast cancer in women who have no signs or symptoms of the disease. It can also be used if you have a lump or other sign of breast cancer.

Screening mammography is the type of mammogram that checks you when you have no symptoms. It can help reduce the number of deaths from breast cancer among women ages 40 to 70. But it can also have drawbacks. Mammograms can sometimes find something that looks abnormal but isn't cancer. This leads to further testing and can cause you anxiety. Sometimes mammograms can miss cancer when it is there. It also exposes you to radiation. You should talk to your doctor about the benefits and drawbacks of mammograms. Together, you can decide when to start and how often to have a mammogram.

Now while its difficult to figure out for physicians  by seeing only images of x-ray that weather the tumor is toxic or not training a machine learning model according to the identification of tumour can be of great help.

# Project Description


The Projects Features Detection of Breast Cancer Using Machine Learning.
It has been tested that while there exists several machine learning models,Support Vector Machine or SVM in short is reported to have highest accuracy of (approximately 97%) in detecting breast cancer.

The dataset used in this project is from Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set, however it can be directly accessed from Scikit learn library's.

# RESULTS 
An accuracy of 96% was achieved by using SVM model and after normalization technique after optimisation of C and Gamma parameters it was increased to a value of a 97%.

# How to access this project.

Fork the Repository and clone it in ur PC 

# Final Note 

To conclude i would like to say that Machine Learning has inspired me for doing great things by learning about great things, this project is one of my starters project in this domain. Doing this project was a pleasure for me and finding out about Death rate due to Breast Cancer really painful.






## Project 5: Credit_Fraud_Detection


**Description**


In this project, I built a credit card fraud detection system using Logistic Regression to classify transactions as fraudulent or legitimate based on transaction data patterns. The objective was to detect anomalies in financial transactions and reduce false positives through proper model evaluation and preprocessing steps.

**Aim:**


To develop a machine learning model using Logistic Regression that accurately classifies credit card transactions as either fraudulent or legitimate, enhancing fraud detection capability and minimizing financial losses.

## Project 6: Disease Prediction System Using SVM ðŸ©º


**Description**


In this project, I developed a machine learning-based disease prediction system using the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm. SVM was chosen for its effectiveness in handling high-dimensional data and binary classification problems. The system processes healthcare datasets containing features such as blood pressure, glucose levels, BMI, age, and more.


**Aim:**


To build and deploy a disease prediction system using SVM that provides accurate, real-time medical predictions based on patient data inputs, supporting early diagnosis and intervention.
